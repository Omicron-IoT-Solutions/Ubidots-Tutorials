# Connect your Kontrolog devices over LoRaWAN or Sigfox to Ubidots
*Learn how to connect your Kontrolog devices to Ubidots through The Things Network (TTN) or the Sigfox Backend, to remotely monitor sensor readings, output status, perform remote control, and send configuration messages to the device.*

The Kontrolog device is a programmable controller for IoT (Internet of Things), designed for remote and real-time control and monitoring of different processes with high security and precision requirements. It can be connected to a touch screen HMI for local visualization and configuration. Adapted to your application, the device can be easily used after installation.

Kontrolog devices have a dual communication module Sigfox/LoRaWAN™ that allows them to send data to the Ubidots platform through either of these two networks, giving it a plus in different application fields, such as industry, agriculture, water quality, home automation, among others.

It includes five (5) Analog/Digital inputs for sensors, one (1) analog input for battery sensor from 0 to 12 VDC, one (1) AC voltage sensor input [0 to 250 VAC], one (1) input to measure AC current in the ranges of 0-30 A, 0-50 A, 0-100 A, one Modbus (RS-485) input port operating as a master on the network, and five (5) control outputs (Relay-type, and analog output, depending on the model of the device ordered).

Following this guide, the user will be able to connect the Kontrolog to Ubidots, using The Things Network (TTN) or the Sigfox Backend. From there, the users will be able to perform, among other things:
+ Remote monitoring and visualization of current measurements, state of the outputs and sensor’s variable records, in graphs and data tables, for up to 2 years.
+ Remote configuration of the device parameters.
+ Alarm management for variables out of range, battery levels, and AC power failure.
+ Set alarm limits, alarm events, and notifications via email, SMS, voicemail, Telegram messaging service, or webhooks.
